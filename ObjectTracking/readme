This notebook demostrates how we can perform object tracking using YOLOv5 and DeepSORT algorithm.
DeepSORT is a well-known object tracking algorithm. It is an extension of the Simple Online Real-time Tracker or SORT, an online tracking algorithm. 
SORT is a method that estimates the location of an object based on its past location using the Kalman filter.
